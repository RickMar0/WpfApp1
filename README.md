# Transparent Clock App

I tried to create this simple clock app because I couldn't find an existing one online that meets my needs. Here are the specifications:

- **Opacity:** The clock should have 50% opacity, allowing it to blend seamlessly with any background.
  
- **Draggable:** I want to be able to move the clock around the screen freely, so it should be draggable by clicking and dragging anywhere on its surface.

- **Always On Top:** The clock should always remain on top of other windows, ensuring that it's easily accessible at all times.

i did NOT write the code myself, i had a friend help me around for the past weeks but now that he's a father he's understandably busy, so here i am trying to figure out how to go forward.

my problem with this app is only one, it fundamentally won't drag around, i tried adding the command and although it doesnt return any errors it still won't budge.
it just spasm around
